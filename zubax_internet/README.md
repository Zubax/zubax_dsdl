Internet messages
=================

The data types contained in this namespace are not designed for use with UAVCAN networks.
Instead, these are just definitions of message formats exchanged over the public Internet via UDP/IP.
DSDL is a convenient binary message specification format even if UAVCAN itself is not used.
