# A list of bit flags indicating constellations, frequency bands, and data sources. This is a nested type.
# A flag is set if the corresponding item is currently being leveraged by the receiver.
# In the rare edge cases where the mapping of the implementation's state to the available bit flags is ambiguous,
# the mapping is to be implementation-defined.
