# Generic CAN adapter status message.
# This is a top-level type in this namespace.
#
# This message is to be published periodically; the recommended frequency is 1 Hz or higher.
# It is recommended to additionally publish this message out-of-band (perhaps at a lower priority value)
# immediately after each reconfiguration.

uavcan.time.SynchronizedTimestamp.1.0 timestamp
# This is intended for adapter diagnostics. If the time is not synchronized, this value should be UNKNOWN (zero).

FaultConfinementStatus.1.0 fault_confinement_status
# The error state per the CAN specification obtained directly from the CAN controller hardware.

FrameCounters.1.0    frame_counters
BusErrorCounters.1.0 bus_error_counters
# The counters shall be reset back to zero when the channel is opened.

uint32 reconfiguration_count
# Incremented by one whenever the adapter receives a new configuration message where the commanded
# configuration is different from the current configuration. Never reset while the adapter is running.

uint7 bus_load_percent
void1
uint7 bus_load_contributed_percent
# Approximate mean CAN bus utilization, in percent, over the last second. The accuracy is implementation-defined.
# The estimate shall reflect the true state of the medium regardless of the acceptance filter configuration.
# The first value is the total bus utilization.
# The second value is the contribution to the total utilization by the bridge itself.
# The following invariants apply: 100% >= total >= tx >= 0%. Values above 100% shall be attributed to an
# estimation error and to be treated as 100%.

PhysicalConfig.1.0 physical_config
# Physical layer configuration parameters.
# These are not the commanded values but the actual properties configured by the adapter.
# For example, if the requested sample point location is 80% but the adapter could only configure 83%,
# the latter value will be reported here.

void16

ConfigResult.1.0 config_result
# The result of the last reconfiguration.
# Normally, if the channel is open, the result should be SUCCESS, since the channel should be closed
# on bad configuration.
# If the channel has been commanded to be closed, the result would be SUCCESS, since closing can't fail.
