# The function of the service heartbeat is similar to that of the node heartbeat defined in the standard namespace,
# except that it is used on a per-service basis, meaning that there may be more than one publisher per node.
#
# The service heartbeat should be published either on a separate subject, or as a structural supertype of a
# service-specific status subject. The publication rate is service-specific but it should not be lower than 1 Hz.
#
# This is a structural subtype of the Readiness type.
# This type is inherited from the original DS-015/UDRAL proposal.

uint8 MAX_PUBLICATION_PERIOD = 1
# Any service that is not in the SLEEP state should publish its heartbeat (or a derived status) at least at this rate.
